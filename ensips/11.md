# ENSIP-11: EVM compatible Chain Address Resolution

Introduces coinType for EVM compatible chains (amending [ENSIP-9](https://docs.ens.domains/ensip/9)).

## Abstract

This ENSIP extends [ENSIP 9 (multichain address resolution)](https://docs.ens.domains/ensip/9), dedicates a range of coin types for EVM compatible chains, and specifies a way to derive EVM chain IDs to the designated coin types.

The dedicated range uses over 0x80000000 (2147483648) which is reserved under ENSIP 9 so there will be no possibility of coin type collision with other non EVM coin types to be added in future. However, some of coin types previously allocated to EVM chain ids will be deprecated.

## Motivation

The existing ENSIP-9 relies on the existence of coin types on [SLIP44](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md) which was designed to define address encoding type for deterministic wallets. As the majority of EVM compatible chains inherit the same encoding type as Ethereum, it is redundant to keep requesting the addition of EVM compatible chains into SLIP 44. This specification standardises a way to derive coinType based on [Chain ID](https://chainlist.org).

Additionally, this specification allows a user to set an EOA/Fallback address for a name. This allows for users to set one address to be used for all EVM-compatible chains, or as a fallback for when a chain-specific address record is not set.

## Specification

This specification amends ENSIP 9 to specify that coin types with the most-significant bit set are to be treated as EVM chain IDs. The MSB is reserved in SLIP44 for other purposes relating to HD wallet key derivation, so no coin types exist in this range.

To compute the new coin type for EVM chains, bitwise-OR the chain ID with `0x80000000`: `0x80000000 | chainId`.

```typescript
export const convertEVMChainIdToCoinType = (chainId: number) =>{
  return  (0x80000000 | chainId) >>> 0
}
```

And to reverse the operation, bitwise-AND the coinType with `0x7fffffff`: `0x7fffffff & coinType`.

```typescript
export const convertCoinTypeToEVMChainId = (coinType: number) =>{
  return  (0x7fffffff & coinType) >> 0
}
```

For EOAs and counterfactual contracts, a fallback address can be specified by using chain ID `0`, resulting in cointype `0x80000000`: `0x80000000` | `0`. The resolution process remains as normal with an additional step. If the initial resolution request does not yield an address, now an extra lookup shall be implemented to check for the existence of an address against the EOA chain ID. 

### Implementation

An implementation of this interface is provided in the [ensdomains/address-encoder](https://github.com/ensdomains/address-encoder/) repository.

### Example

To compute the new coin type for EVM chains, call `convertEVMChainIdToCoinType(chainId)`

```javascript
const encoder = require('@ensdomains/address-encoder')
>  encoder.convertEVMChainIdToCoinType(61)
2147483709
> encoder.convertCoinTypeToEVMChainId(2147483709)
61
```

You can also use existing functions formatsByName and formatsByCoinType to derive these chain IDs

```javascript
> encoder.formatsByName['XDAI']
{
 coinType: 2147483748,
 decoder: [Function (anonymous)],
 encoder: [Function (anonymous)],
 name: 'XDAI'
}
> encoder.formatsByCoinType[2147483748]
{
 coinType: 2147483748,
 decoder: [Function (anonymous)],
 encoder: [Function (anonymous)],
 name: 'XDAI'
}
```

### Exceptions

The following EVM chains are the exception to this standard.

* AVAX = AVAX has multiple chain address formats, and only c chain is EVM compatible
* RSK = RSK has its own additional validation

They will continue using coinType defined at SLIP44

### Backwards Compatibility

The following EVM compatible cointypes existed before introducing this new standard.

* NRG
* POA
* TT
* CELO
* CLO
* TOMO
* EWT
* THETA
* GO
* FTM
* XDAI
* ETC

When you display them for backward compatibility purposes, append `_LEGACY` to the cointype and make them read only.
