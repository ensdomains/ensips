# ENSIP-16: Metadata Event Discovery

## Abstract

This ENSIP specifies APIs for querying metadata directly on the resolver for EIP-3668 (CCIP Read: Secure offchain data retrieval) enabled names. EIP-3668 will power many domains in the future, however since the retrieval mechanism uses wildcard + offchain resolver, there is no standardised way to retrieve important metadata information such as which L2/offchain database the records are stored on and where JSON RPC endpoint is to find event log information.

## Motivation

With EIP-3668 subdomains already starting to see wide adoption, it is important that there is a standardised way to discover and access metadata about offchain names.

This ENSIP allows third-party indexing services to listen to the `MetadataChanged` event to automatically discover and index metadata from different chains and smart contracts, without relying on centralised RPC endpoint repositories.

## Specification

Resolver implements the following Solidity interface:

```solidity
// To be included in
// https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/blob/staging/contracts/resolvers/Resolver.sol
interface IOffchainResolverMetadataProvider {

    /**
     * @dev Returns metadata for discovering the location of offchain name data
     * @param name DNS-encoded name to query
     * @return rpcURLs The JSON RPC endpoint for querying offchain data (optional, may be empty array)
     * @return chainId The chain ID where the data is stored (format for non-EVM systems to be determined)
     * @return baseRegistry The base registry address on the target chain that emits events (optional, may be zero address)
     */
    function metadata(bytes calldata name)
        external
        view
        returns (
            string[] memory rpcURLs,
            uint256 chainId,
            address baseRegistry
        );

    event MetadataChanged(
        bytes name,              // DNS-encoded name
        string[] rpcURLs,        // JSON RPC endpoint (optional, may be empty array)
        uint256 chainId,         // Chain identifier (format for non-EVM systems to be determined)
        address baseRegistry     // Base registry address (optional, may be zero address)
    );
}
```

**Requirements:**
- `chainId` must be provided. For EVM-compatible chains, `chainId` SHOULD match the chain's EIP-155 identifier. The format for non-EVM or off-chain systems is to be determined.
- `rpcURLs` is optional and may be an empty array.
- `baseRegistry` is optional and may be the zero address. If a non-zero address is specified, events will be emitted from this address. The interface of this contract is yet to be determined.

### metadata function

The metadata function allows resolvers to dynamically provide information about where offchain data for a given name can be queried. This function returns the same information as would be emitted in a MetadataChanged event: the JSON RPC endpoint URLs, the chain ID where the data resides, and the base registry address on the target chain.

### MetadataChanged Event

The MetadataChanged event emits the same information the `metadata` function returns so that indexers can subscribe to the event as the details change rather than periodically querying the function.

## Rationale

This ENSIP addresses a key limitation of EIP-3668: while it enables offchain data retrieval, it provides no standardized way for third parties to discover where that data lives or how to index it.

By providing metadata at the resolver level, this ENSIP enables:

1. **Automatic indexer discovery** - Indexers can discover new L2/offchain data sources by listening to events, without requiring manual configuration or centralized registries of RPC endpoints.

2. **Flexible data sources** - The optional nature of `rpcURLs` and `baseRegistry` accommodates different deployment patterns: from fully decentralized L2 registries that emit events, to custom databases that only provide metadata for discovery purposes.

3. **Future extensibility** - By requiring `chainId` but leaving the non-EVM format undefined, this ENSIP establishes the pattern while remaining open to future non-EVM integrations.
