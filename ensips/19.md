# ENSIP-19: Multichain Primary Names

## Abstract

This ENSIP standardizes [reverse](#reverse-resolution) and [primary name](#algorithm) resolution for all coin types, and defines how this resolution process operates across the [multichain Ethereum](#multichain-ethereum) ecosystem.

## Motivation

[ENSIP-1](./1.md) established the resolution of Ethereum addresses by name.  [ENSIP-9](./9.md) introduced coin types and assigned the Ethereum address to a coin type.  [ENSIP-11](./11.md) defined an algorithm to convert between chains and coin types.

[ENSIP-3](./3.md) established the reverse resolution process for Ethereum addresses.  However, the generalization of this process for arbitrary coin types does not exist.

Since EVM-compatible chains have become the [primary scaling solution](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/) for Ethereum, an Ethereum-wide default name is essential to ensure consistent identity resolution across all chains.

Additionally, because EVM-compatible chains have the same address encoding, chain-agonstic addresses—such as externally owned accounts (EoA) and deterministic deployment proxies—motivate an Ethereum-wide default address.

With the rise of [smart contract accounts](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/) (SCA) and presence of different address derivation schemes, a modern ENS identity likely has multiple addresses accross the Ethereum ecosystem.

## Specification

Primary name resolution is a two-phase procedure that takes `addressBytes` and `coinType` as input, and returns no name or a verified primary name.

### Definitions

- `addressBytes` — the target address as bytes, according to [ENSIP-9 § Address Encoding](./9.md#address-encoding).
- `[addressAsHex]` — prefix-free lowercase hexadecimal representation of `addressBytes`.
   * eg. `0x0000ABcD` &rarr; `"0000abcd"`
- `coinType` — the target coin type, according to [ENSIP-9](./9.md).
   * `coinType = 60` corresponds to the mainnet Ethereum address.
      * L1 testnets (like Sepolia) may also use this `coinType`.
   * `coinType` can be derived from a 31-bit EVM `chainId`, according to [ENSIP-11](./11.md).
      * `chainId = 0` corresponds to the default EVM chain.
- `[coinTypeAsHex]` — prefix-free lowercase hexadecimal representation of `coinType` without leading zeros.
   * equivalent to `BigInt(coinType).toString(16)` in JavaScript.
   * eg. `4095` &rarr; `"fff"`
- `chainFromCoinType(coinType)`
   * If `coinType = 60`, returns `1`.
   * If `0x8000_0000 ≤ coinType ≤ 0xffff_ffff`, returns `coinType ^ 0x8000_0000`.
   * Otherwise, returns `0`.
     | Network     | `coinType`      | `chainFromCoinType()` | EVM
     | :--         | --:             | --:                   | :-:
     | *Default*   | `0x8000_0000`   | `0`                   | ✓
     | Ethereum    | `60`            | `1`                   | ✓
     | Chain(2)    | `0x8000_0002`   | `2`                   | ✓
     | Bitcoin     | `0`             | `0`                   |
     | ?           | `0x1_8000_0002` | `0`                   |
- `resolve(name, data)` — an [ENSIP-10](./10.md) implementation.

### Algorithm

#### Reverse Resolution
1. Generate `reverseName` with `coinType` where:
   | `coinType`    | `reverseName`
   | --:           | :--
   | `60`          | `"[addressAsHex].addr.reverse"`
   | `0x8000_0000` | `"[addressAsHex].default.reverse"`
   | `*`           | `"[addressAsHex].[coinTypeAsHex].reverse"`
2. Compute `reverseNode = namehash(reverseName)`.
3. Resolve `name = resolve(reverseName, abi.encodeCall(INameResolver.name, (reverseNode)))`.
4. If `name` is empty, no primary name exists for this address.
   * Stop and display the address.
5. `name` is the primary name if and only if it resolves to the same `addressBytes`.

#### Forward Resolution
6. Compute `node = namehash(name)`.
7. Resolve `resolvedAddress = resolve(name, callData)` where:
   | `coinType` | `callData`
   | --:        | :--
   | `60`       | `abi.encodeCall(IAddrResolver.addr, (node))`
   | `*`        | `abi.encodeCall(IAddressResolver.addr, (node, coinType))`
8. If `resolvedAddress != addressBytes`, no primary name exists for this address.
   * Stop and display the address.
9. `name` is the primary name.

### Multichain Ethereum

A new standalone registrar contract will maintain an `address` &rarr; `name` mapping and grant accounts of the host chain the ability to manage their `name` via various trustless mechanisms.

Unlike reverse registrations in [ENSIP-3](./3.md), the new registrar is registry-independent and does not support custom resolvers or records.

Resolving `addr(node, coinType)` on a reverse namespace will return the address of the corresponding registrar.

#### Default Primary Name

A new registrar contract will be deployed on L1 for default names.  An [ENSIP-10](./10.md) wildcard resolver registered at `"reverse"` will utilize the default registrar.  The default resolver will intercept `"default.reverse"` and `"[coinTypeAsHex].reverse"` for every `chainFromCoinType(coinType) > 0` and lookup names when `addressAsHex` is a valid EVM address.

#### Chain-specific Primary Name

New registrars will be deployed per chain, but only those that post state to L1 (such as [rollups](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/#rollups)) may have a corresponding ENSIP-10 wildcard resolver at `"[coinTypeAsHex].reverse"`.  

Each resolver will trustlessly verify registrar lookups on the corresponding chain when `addressAsHex` is a valid EVM address.  If no name is assocated with the address, the resolver will return the default name from the default registrar.

#### Example

> The resolver for `chainId = 2` is registered at `"80000002.reverse"`. 
>
> The primary name of `0xb8c2C29ee19D8307cb7255e1Cd9CbDE883A267d5` on this chain corresponds to resolving the `name()` of `"b8c2c29ee19d8307cb7255e1cd9cbde883a267d5.80000002.reverse"`. 
>
> If this chain was not a rollup, the reverse name would be intercepted by the default resolver, and the primary name becomes the default name.

### Default Address

Similar to [ENSIP-9 § Backwards Compatibility](./9.md/#backwards-compatibility) which states:
> the value returned by `addr(node)` from ENSIP-1 should always match the value returned `addr(node, 60)`

If `chainFromCoinType(coinType) > 0`, the value returned by `addr(node, coinType)`, when no address is stored for `coinType`, should always match the value returned by `addr(node, 0x8000_0000)`.

## Backwards Compatibility

This specification requires no modification to ENSIP-10 resolution.

Unlike the new registrar [defined above](#multichain-ethereum), the [ENSIP-3](./3.md/#appendix-1-registrar-implementation) registrar assigned a resolver to `"[addressAsHex].addr.reverse"`.  To clear this registration, the reverse resolver must be replaced with a default-aware resolver or the resolver must be unset.  An unaware resolver with an unset name will not fallback to the default name.

Most resolvers do not implement the [default address logic](#default-address) and will need redeployed.  Alternatively, the same address can be set for all relevant coin types to replicate the default behavior.

### Deprecating Reverse Name Avatars

[ENSIP-12](./12.md) defined avatars for reverse names, which allowed accounts to have avatars without an ENS name. Adoption of this is virtually non-existent, and ENS names are more accessible than ever before (free), which effectively removes the need for it entirely.

The reverse resolvers defined in this specification do not support `text()`.

### Deprecating Mainnet as Default

ENS has not been explicit about how to use the mainnet address record `addr()` and it is often used as a default when a chain address is not present.  Additionally, mainnet primary names have historically been used on other chains as there was no alternative.

Clients must remove all logic related to default address and name handling.

#### Example

> User A on chain C wants to transfer assets to user B, who operates a SCA on L1.
>
> 1. User A enters the mainnet address of user B.
> 2. The application verifies and displays the mainnet primary name of user B.
> 3. User A confidently executes the transfer on chain C.
>
> Due to the specifics of SCA creation, user B likely has no ability to claim the matching counterfactual address on chain C, and the assets are unrecoverable.
